# Software Used:
Xampp –used phpMyAdmin for creating a database of websites which contain different tables such
as Order table, product table, User table,etc.



Visual Studio – used for writing php,css and html code of all the pages of a website.
# Description:
Our website name is “GOGREEN”.This website can be used by both the user and the admin. Admin has its
separate pages where he/she can handle the users, products, payments and many more. We have provided a
unique email and password to the admin so that no user can enter the admin pages. Admin can be able to
view the no. of orders placed, pending payments, he/she can add products to the site.
After logging in to the website, the user can be able to see the products, they can buy the products, they can
contact the nursery with the help of contact no. provided on the website or they can message them through
the website itself. Users can ask for any help related to nursery or related to the plants for example. How to
maintain plants? How to take care of plants?
# Conclusion:
In this mini project we have implemented database connectivity,html,php,css.To make the website user
friendly we have used relational queries .On the other hand, we have made the website such a way that
admin can handle all the user activities such as No. of orders placed by a user,No.of users login,Messages
sent by user,etc.We have provided a option of payment update to the admin so that he/she can change the
payment status of user after order is delivered.
In this way we have implemented our knowledge that we have learned from database management. In this
mini project.Doing this we have learnt different things such as use of Xampp ,visual studio etc.
